         <h1> Andrea Palladio.</h1>
         <p class="ssp">
            Italian architect. New exhibition celebrates Palladio’s architecture 500 years on.
         </p>
         <h2 class="a"> A</h2>
         <span class="span">
            Vicenza is a pleasant, prosperous city in the Veneto, 60km west of Venice. Its grand families settled and
            farmed the area from the 16th century. But its principal claim to fame is Andrea Palladio, who is such an
            influential architect that a neoclassical style is known as Palladian. The city is a permanent exhibition of
            some of his finest buildings, and as he was born – in Padua, to be precise – 500 years ago, the
            International
            Centre for the Study of Palladio’s Architecture has an excellent excuse for mounting la grande Mostra, the
            big
            show
         </span>
         <h2> B</h2>
         <span>
            The exhibition has the special advantage of being held in one of Palladio’s buildings, Palazzo Barbaran da
            Porto. Its bold façade is a mixture of rustication and decoration set between two rows of elegant columns.
            On
            the second floor, the pediments are alternately curved or pointed, a Palladian trademark. The harmonious
            proportions of the atrium at the entrance lead through to a dramatic interior of fine fireplaces and painted
            ceilings. Palladio’s design is simple, clear and not over-crowded. The show has been organised on
            the same principles, according to Howard Burns, the architectural historian who co-curated it.
         </span>

         <h2>C</h2>

         <span>
            Palladio’s father was a miller who settled in Vicenza, where the young Andrea was apprenticed to a skilled
            stonemason. How did a humble miller’s son become a world-renowned architect? The answer in the exhibition is
            that, as a young man, Palladio excelled at carving decorative stonework on columns, doorways and fireplaces.
            He was plainly intelligent, and lucky enough to come across a rich patron, Gian Giorgio Trissino, a
            landowner and scholar, who organised his education, taking him to Rome in the 1540s, where he studied the
            masterpieces of classical Roman and Greek architecture and the work of other influential architects of the
            time, such as Donato Bramante and Raphael.

            Burns argues that social mobility was also important. Entrepreneurs, prosperous from agriculture in the
            Veneto, commissioned the promising local architect to design their country villas and their urban mansions.
            In Venice, the aristocracy was anxious to co-opt talented artists, and Palladio has given the chance to
            design the buildings that have made him famous – the churches of San Giorgio Maggiore and the Redentore,
            both easy to admire because they can be seen from the city’s historical centre across a stretch of water.

            He tried his hand at bridges – his unbuilt version of the Rialto Bridge was decorated with the large
            pediment and columns of a temple – and, after a fire at the Ducal Palace, he offered an alternative design
            which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Banqueting House in Whitehall in London. Since it was designed by
            Inigo Jones, Palladio’s first foreign disciple, this is not as surprising as it sounds.

            Jones, who visited Italy in 1614, bought a trunk full of the master’s architectural drawings; they passed
            through the hands of Dukes of Burlington and Devonshire before settling at the Royal Institute of British
            Architects in 1894. Many are now on display at Palazzo Barbaran. What they show is how Palladio drew on the
            buildings of ancient Rome as models. The major theme of both his rural and urban building was temple
            architecture, with a strong pointed pediment supported by columns and approached by wide steps.
         </span>
         <h2> G</h2>
         <span>
            Palladio’s work for rich landowners alienates unreconstructed critics on the Italian left, but among the
            papers in the show are designed for cheap housing in Venice. In the wider world, Palladio’s reputation has
            been nurtured by a text he wrote and illustrated, “Quattro Libri dell’ Architettura”. His influence spread
            to St Petersburg and to Charlottesville in Virginia, where Thomas Jefferson commissioned a Palladian villa
            he called Monticello.

         <h2>H</h2>
         <span>

            Vicenza’s show contains detailed models of the major buildings and is leavened by portraits of Palladio’s
            teachers and clients by Titian, Veronese and Tintoretto; the paintings of his Venetian buildings are all by
            Canaletto, no less. This is an uncompromising exhibition; many of the drawings are small and faint, and
            there
            are no sideshows for children, but the impact of harmonious lines and satisfying proportions is
            to impart in a viewer a feeling of benevolent calm. Palladio is history’s most therapeutic architect.
            “Palladio, 500 Anni: La Grande Mostra” is at Palazzo Barbaran da Porto, Vicenza, until January 6th 2009. The
            exhibition continues at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, from January 31st to April 13th, and travels
            afterwards to Barcelona and Madrid.

<h1>Sample Answer 1 </h1>
<h2>Here is the sample for “Describe a house/apartment you like to live in” topic</h2>

<span>
   Currently, I’m living in an independent house with my family. However, I would love to live in an apartment.
   One of the reasons why I want to live in an apartment is because of the balcony. I’d want my apartment to have a huge balcony that I can decorate with plants and a comfortable chair. I’d like to sit there on a rainy day or a cold night. I don’t want a huge apartment – anything that has up to 3 bedrooms with attached bathrooms, a living area, and an adequately spaced kitchen would suffice.
   Unfortunately, such apartments are not in my city; thus, I’d have to shift to another city. Right now, my sister is yet to complete her school, and it will take her two years to finish it. Only then can I move to another city, in an apartment, with my family.
   Presently, my house is situated in the middle of the city and is surrounded by a traffic-prone road as well as a myriad of shops and factories around. Owing to this, I hardly get any quietness and stillness, except for the nighttime. Thus, I would like this apartment to be in a locality that is secluded from the main city and is quiet to experience stillness.
